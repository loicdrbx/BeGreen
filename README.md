## Inspiration 🌱
Climate change is affecting every region on earth. The changes are widespread, rapid, and intensifying. The UN states that we are at a pivotal moment and the urgency to protect our Earth is at an all-time high. We wanted to harness the power of social media for a greater purpose: promoting sustainability and environmental consciousness. 

## What it does 🌎
Inspired by BeReal, the most popular app in 2022, BeGreen is your go-to platform for celebrating and sharing acts of sustainability. Everytime you make a sustainable choice, snap a photo, upload it, and you’ll be rewarded with Green points based on how impactful your act was! Compete with your friends to see who can rack up the most Green points by performing more acts of sustainability and even claim prizes once you have enough points 😍.

## How we built it 🧑‍💻
We used React with Javascript to create the app, coupled with firebase for the backend. We also used Microsoft Azure for computer vision and OpenAI for assessing the environmental impact of the sustainable act in a photo. 

## Challenges we ran into 🥊
One of our biggest obstacles was settling on an idea as there were so many great challenges for us to be inspired from. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆
We are really happy to have worked so well as a team. Despite encountering various technological challenges, each team member embraced unfamiliar technologies with enthusiasm and determination. We were able to overcome obstacles by adapting and collaborating as a team and we’re all leaving uOttahack with new capabilities. 

## What we learned 💚
Everyone was able to work with new technologies that they’ve never touched before while watching our idea come to life. For all of us, it was our first time developing a progressive web app. For some of us, it was our first time working with OpenAI, firebase, and working with routers in react. 

## What's next for BeGreen ✨
It would be amazing to collaborate with brands to give more rewards as an incentive to make more sustainable choices. We’d also love to implement a streak feature, where you can get bonus points for posting multiple days in a row!
